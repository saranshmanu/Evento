### What is IEEE VIT SB?
IEEE VIT Core Committee is one of the most active chapters inside Region 10 of IEEE International. We boast of highly skilled members in technical and non-technical disciplines. The IEEE Region 10, also sometimes referred as the Asia Pacific Region, comprises of 57 Sections, 6 Councils, 17 Sub-sections, 515 Chapters, 60 Affinity Groups and 958 Student Branches. It covers a geographical area stretching from South Korea and Japan in the north-east to New Zealand in the south, and Pakistan in the west. With over 100,000 members it is one of the largest regions in IEEE.

### Concept behind the application
Each year IEEE VIT SB host its flagship event once in every year and the developers have to develop a new event management application from scratch everytime. To save developer time and resources members of IEEE VIT SB came up with an idea to create a common platform where you can generate application and event website for every new event whether it is a technical session, technical fest or hackathon to be organised with just a customisable event coodinator web application. Every time you can modify the application and update it according to the next event that is going to be organied. 

We organised IEEE Techloop Congress in the fall of 2018 and the application was generated with the same platform
